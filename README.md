# OpenGL 3D Engine

An OpenGL-based 3D engine built for Win32, supporting features like Vertex Array Object (VAO), shaders, Uniform Buffer Object (UBO), camera system, lighting, skybox, terrain, and more. This project demonstrates real-time rendering techniques and includes an entity system, input system, and animation capabilities.

## Features

- **Win32 window handling** for custom window creation and input management.
- **Vertex Array Object (VAO)** to efficiently manage vertex attributes.
- **Shader management** to handle custom shaders (vertex, fragment, etc.).
- **Uniform Buffer Object (UBO)** for dynamic uniform handling across shaders.
- **Camera System** supporting first-person, third-person, and free-look views.
- **Texturing and lighting** for realistic material rendering.
- **Mesh loader** to import and render 3D models.
- **Skybox, terrain, and ocean** rendering for complex environments.
- **Entity system** to manage and render objects in the scene.
- **Animation** and real-time transformations.
